UPDATE:
On New Years Day around 3am, Family of George Floyd was targeted by a shooter. Ariana Delaney, four years old, was shot, breaking three ribs and injuring internal organs: liver and lung. She has survived. Barely.
Perhaps it was assumed that Fireworks noise would drown out the gunfire. And the police did not arrive on the scene until several hours later. EMS did not even arrive... The family drove their bleeding critically wounded 4 year old to the hospital themselves. Because in Our World, Black Lives Matter... LESS.

Open your history books and read about Emmett Till. So long ago... 1955, a sign of the times, I guess. Back then, Racism ran rampant. Below, in my Original Entry on this theme, I point out the disparity on how too many people think Racism is a thing of the past.
January 1st 2022 - Ariana Delaney, age 4, shot in a Hate Crime, based only and solely on how she had more Melanin in her skin than some other people have. 
Is THIS the past? Are our Patriots Fighting for Our Freedom here? Shall we sing of the Hireling and the Slave?
THIS IS TODAY. This is now.
I still wear the symbol 8:46 on my face mask to this day - every time I show my face in public. I have had some ask me, "That was a long time ago, now. Why do you still carry it?" Because as the pain of it fades, we begin to forget. As we forget, it blows over and nothing changes. You do not get to forget. I will remind you. I'm going to keep on reminding you. We will carry it.
This is Our Country in 2022.

1-1-22  Justice and a Speedy and Full recovery for Ariana Delaney.

Original Background:

On May 25, 2020, a life was taken and a hero was born.
George Floyd did not want to be a hero. He was just trying to live.
He made mistakes. He struggled. As many of us Americans do. George Washington made many great mistakes, too. He too, is a hero.
In spite of being one of many Americans, Floyd's life was not truly valued as one.
Over the course of about eleven minutes, his life was drained away as he was slowly replaced as a human being into a symbol.

A symbol of the struggles of being black in America.

Yes, we can say that All Lives Matter. The problem is not that Black lives do not matter. The problem is that Black Lives Matter... Less.

It is interesting how one can drive through many neighborhoods and see such radical differences. Driving through a wealthy or an upper middle class neighborhood, you see far more trees. But driving through a poorer neighborhood, you often see more pavement, gravel or flat ground. Much of this has to do with zoning that took place long ago. Zoning driven by racial divides of the past. Yet, it remains to this day. Wealthier people have more shade on their houses, providing better cooling in the summer and pay less in air conditioning. While poorer people pay more for air conditioning, in less shaded neighborhoods. It is not because white people today are all racist. It is because racists in our history seized power - and in the time since, we did nothing to Make it Right. We did not rezone. We did not plant trees. We did not Value the black lives the same way we valued others. We did not acknowledge the problem.
And we still turn our eyes away.
As a nation, we have made remarkable progress and great strides. We have confronted racism, improved our school curriculum and passed laws to protect all U.S. Citizens. The Hiring market for black people in the U.S.A. is the best it has ever been. But is it as good as it is for others? Did we reach 70% or 80% and decide that was good enough? While poorer schools in poorer neighborhoods got less funding, less room for advancement, less opportunities. That is systemic racism. That is how it works, and why it is so easy to not see it.

A white person does not walk into a restaurant and be treated especially better than a black patron. They are treated the same. A white person does not get to sit at the front of the bus, while blacks are delegated to the rear. Many white people pay the same taxes as a black person. Drive the same cars and pay the same price for them. Even live in the same neighborhoods. Where is the White Privilege? It's hard to see... Yet, it is there to see... When a black man is pinned beneath a knee long after he has stopped breathing. That is White Privilege. It is not obvious in daily life. It only is, when Black Lives Matter... Less.

That is what Systemic Racism is. Some of it is racism that was put in place long ago, that remains in the system, today. And it remains even when racism motivates new laws, and Americans turn a blind eye. Protected by the color of their skin. Many good people today think of racism as a terrible stain in our history - a thing of our past. White people struggle, go homeless, go hungry, go to jail... all the time. But it begs the question: If George Floyd had been white on 25 May 2020 - would he have died under someones knee?

We have made great progress. We have eliminated color bars in Universities. We have eliminated legal segregation. We have made it the law, that companies may only hire equally. But not all companies, do, they just hide it. Not all home appraisals are honest, they just make more excuses.

We have come a long way... But the fight's not over, yet.

Because on the 25th of May of 2020, a black mans life mattered... Less. He was not important enough to be treated with the same rights, same dignity and same benefit of the doubt as others. He was killed, on the street, pleading for air. Calling to his mother. Racial inequality remains. Black Lives matter... Most of the time.

The majority of cops are good people. People like George Floyd. People that want to just do their jobs and live their lives. People that are just trying to live. And people who sometimes make mistakes. But there are a few... A few that do not value the lives of some in our society as much as others. And we must hold them accountable. Police Departments must expose them, instead of trying to save face by hiding the realities of our society. Together, we can stand against the remains of Systemic Racism as much as existing and current racism. But we can only do so If We Remember.
As the pain of George Floyds homicide begins to fade, we begin to forget. And when we forget, nothing changes. Racism is perceived as a thing of the past. Even as its presence remains among us; systemic; unaddressed.

We Can Never Forget. Emmett Till. George Floyd. And so many others, whose lives mattered less. Or not at all.

And as white officers, with sincerity, addressed our country in silence and on bended knee - George Floyd became a hero. A symbol of the job we have ahead of us. Not behind us. Because This Is Still Now.
Not in the past, but tomorrow, and the day after, Together. With the Speech of "I can't breathe..." George Floyd united a nation of all people, of all walks of life, of all cultures, beliefs, identities and opinions in One Cause: Equality and Justice For ALL.

It does not matter how much melanin you have in your skin. How much money you make. What your job is. It does not matter what political party you identify with. This is Humanity. This is All Of Us. Racism is not some white disease, that only white people get. It is not a relic of the past. It is Here. Embedded in our System. Alive in the hearts and minds of the few, of the Minority.

As I type this, I debated with myself as to whether or not I should discuss my own race.
It's... complicated.
Looking at me, with my reddish hair, my green eyes and my pale skin, you undoubtedly would call me white. I am Cis. Heterosexual.
I am very proud of my Culture, My heritage. The teachings I have been freely given as a member of my people: The Lakota Tribe.
I can tell you... that I do not get Special Treatment. I do not get a free get out of jail card. I do not get to get away with things... Yet, I am still treated differently than the other members of my tribe. I am not treated with the same suspicion. I am not assumed to be an alcoholic. I am not Profiled the way that they are.
I am Aravisian.
I am Proud to be an American.
With knowledge, comes progress. With understanding, comes peace.

We Will Never Forget.

In Memory...
